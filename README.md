# archey-osx-ppc
Frankenstein amalgamation of Archey script from Homebrew and Archey-osx from joshfinnie. Replaces the sysctl method of discovering CPU type and speed, instead uses hwprefs utility included with Xcode. As such, it requires Xcode to be installed. If you are running a seriously ancient version of OS X, and/or do not have Xcode installed, try archey-osx-ppc-nox.
